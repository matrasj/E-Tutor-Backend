# E-Tutor-Backend
Application E-Tutor is some kind of clone of polish application E-Korepetycje ( https://www.e-korepetycje.net )
For storing data I used MySQL database. For sending email confirmations I used MAILDEV (https://github.com/maildev/maildev) project and created created container using Docker. For authentication and authorization I used JWT with roles.

Main purpose of application is to create place in web where we can post advertisements about tutoring. We can either post advertisement when we want to teach and also when we need some help. 

More info about project and screenshots you can find in frontend repo written with help of Angular framework here -> https://github.com/pozerinhooo/E-Tutor-FrontEnd
