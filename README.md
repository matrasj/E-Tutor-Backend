# E-Tutor-Backend
Application E-Tutor is some kind of clone of polish application E-Korepetycje ( https://www.e-korepetycje.net ).

For storing data I used MySQL database. For sending email confirmations I used MAILDEV (https://github.com/maildev/maildev) project and created container using Docker technology. For authentication and authorization I used JWT with roles.

Main purpose of application is to create place in web where we can post advertisements about tutoring. We can post advertisement either as a person who wants to teach and also who needs help.

More info about project and screenshots you can find in frontend repo written with help of Angular framework here -> https://github.com/pozerinhooo/E-Tutor-FrontEnd
